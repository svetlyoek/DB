The intensive database fundamentals course will introduce you to one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) used in the development of modern information systems - Microsoft SQL Server. The course pays close attention to the relational model, the modeling of data with ER diagrams (tables and relational links), and the use of SQL (data extraction, selection, projection, connections, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion and insertion).Basic knowledge of working with ACID transactions and transactional processing, as well as practical performance tuning tips, is provided. This course lays the foundations for working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications and understanding concepts like turning a database into an object-oriented model (ORM). The course details the work with ORM technology: Entity Framework Core (EF core), which is the standard for ORM in C # and .NET Core applications. EF Core enables mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model through the "database first" and "code first" approaches, and provides a powerful object-oriented database query and CRUD operations API. We will demonstrate established practices for building a database layer on complex systems using the "Repository" and " Unit of Work " templates. Every part of the course ends with a practical exam.
